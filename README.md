# XML Filter for Open/Neo/LibreOffice

This is an XSLT filter for LibreOffice that exports ODT documents to a presentationally neutral XML. This XML organizes the titles hierarchichally (h2 are nested inside h1 in a Table of Contents). 

This makes possible to export this XML to epub, html, pdf or any other xml-compatible format.
